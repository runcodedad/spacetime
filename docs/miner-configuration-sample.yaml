# Sample Miner Configuration

# This is a sample configuration file for the Spacetime miner.
# Copy this to ~/.spacetime/miner.yaml and customize as needed.

# Directory where plot files are stored
plotDirectory: /path/to/plots

# Path to the plot metadata JSON file
# This file tracks all plots managed by the miner
plotMetadataPath: /path/to/plots_metadata.json

# IP address of the full node to connect to
nodeAddress: 127.0.0.1

# Port of the full node
nodePort: 8333

# Path to the miner's private key file
# This key is used to sign blocks and proofs
privateKeyPath: /path/to/miner_key.dat

# Network identifier
# Options: "mainnet", "testnet"
networkId: testnet

# Path to the chain storage database
# This is where the node's chain database files (leveldb/rocksdb, etc.) are stored
chainStoragePath: /path/to/storage

# Performance Settings
# =====================

# Maximum number of concurrent proof generation tasks
# Higher values can improve performance on multi-core systems
# but will use more memory and CPU
maxConcurrentProofs: 1

# Timeout for proof generation in seconds
# If proof generation takes longer than this, it will be cancelled
proofGenerationTimeoutSeconds: 60

# Connection Settings
# ====================

# Interval in seconds between connection retry attempts
connectionRetryIntervalSeconds: 5

# Maximum number of connection retry attempts before giving up
maxConnectionRetries: 10

# Monitoring Settings
# ====================

# Enable detailed performance monitoring
# When enabled, the miner tracks and reports:
# - Total challenges received
# - Total proofs generated
# - Total proofs submitted
# - Total blocks won
enablePerformanceMonitoring: true

# Environment Variable Overrides
# ================================
#
# You can override any configuration value using environment variables
# with the prefix SPACETIME_MINER_:
#
# SPACETIME_MINER_PLOT_DIRECTORY=/custom/plots
# SPACETIME_MINER_NODE_ADDRESS=192.168.1.100
# SPACETIME_MINER_NODE_PORT=9000
# SPACETIME_MINER_NETWORK_ID=mainnet
# SPACETIME_MINER_MAX_CONCURRENT_PROOFS=4
# SPACETIME_MINER_CHAIN_STORAGE_PATH=/custom/storage
#
# Environment variables take precedence over values in this file.
