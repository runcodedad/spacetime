# 🌌 Spacetime Blockchain

> **Spacetime** — a fair, low-energy blockchain where **disk and time** prove value.

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Spacetime** is an experimental blockchain designed to explore a **Proof-of-Space-Time (PoST)** consensus model — a novel, energy-efficient alternative to Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS).

Instead of burning energy or locking tokens, miners **prove they dedicate disk space over time**.  
This makes Spacetime:
- 🟢 **Low in energy consumption** — no GPUs or ASICs required.  
- ⚖️ **Fair and accessible** — anyone with free disk space can mine.  
- 🧠 **Educational** — a readable, modular blockchain built for learning.

> 💡 *Built in C# / .NET 10 as a clean, composable learning project.*

## 🧩 Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Proof of Space (PoS)** | Miners generate local *plots* — files filled with deterministic pseudorandom data. |
| **Proof of Space-Time (PoST)** | Extends PoS by requiring miners to remain active over time (epochs). |
| **Challenge** | Deterministic seed derived from the last block’s hash and randomness beacon. |
| **Plot File** | On-disk structure miners scan to produce proofs. |
| **Epoch** | A fixed period in which challenges and proofs occur. |
| **Proof** | Cryptographic evidence that a miner has valid data matching the challenge. |

## 🧱 Project Roadmap

Spacetime is developed in **incremental phases**:

1. **Core Blockchain Layer** — blocks, transactions, and chainstate  
2. **Plotting System** — deterministic proof-of-space files  
3. **Consensus Engine** — PoST challenge and difficulty logic  
4. **Networking Layer** — peer sync and gossip protocol  
5. **Wallet & CLI** — local keys, mining, and monitoring  
6. **Epoch Logic** — time-based participation and decay  
7. **Testing & Simulation** — local testnet and performance tuning  

A detailed list of requirements is available in [`docs/requirements.md`](docs/implementation-checklist.md).
